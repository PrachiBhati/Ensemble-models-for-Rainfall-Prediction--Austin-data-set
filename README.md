# Ensemble-models-for-Rainfall-Prediction--Austin-data-set
Rainfall prediction is most important part of the agriculture and helped farmers in harvesting the crops at right time. Predicting the rainfall with correct accuracy will save the lives of people in coastal areas where flood and heavy rainfall is common. Various research works have been done on rainfall predication using statistical and Artificial intelligence approaches. In this proposed work Multi linear Regression and Support Vector Regression are implemented. Then Ensemble learning Models â€“Decision tree Regressor, Random forest Regressor and tried with Austin dataset and comparison results are shown in the graph.
